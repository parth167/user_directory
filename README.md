## Project Description

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

* The user is allowed to search the directory of employees using the first and last name.
* In addition they would be able to sort according to ascending and descending by selecting the arrow next to First Name and Last Name.
